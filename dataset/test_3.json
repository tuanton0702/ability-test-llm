    "instruction": "I bought a new monitor which only accepts HDMI, but my computer only has VGA ports. Can I still connect them, or do I need to buy a new computer?",
    "answer": "It is possible to connect a monitor with an HDMI port to a computer with only VGA ports, but you will need to purchase an HDMI-to-VGA adapter or converter. These adapters can be found at most electronics stores or online retailers. Alternatively, you could consider upgrading your computer's graphics card or purchasing a new computer with an HDMI port to avoid the need for an adapter. Ultimately, the best option will depend on your budget and specific needs. "
